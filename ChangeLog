	* test.cs: make the sample program dump all the refs.

	* Lib/Repository.cs: Expose GetAllRefs.

	* Lib/RefDatabase.cs (ReadOneLooseRef): Do not crash if the
	refName is not present in the looseKeys.

	(RefreshPackedRefs): If the packed-refs file does not exist, do
	not try to continue, it would otherwise crash.

	* Lib/WindowedFile.cs: Implement another file from the original
	Java implementation.

	* Lib/PackIndex.cs: Fix indentation of comment.

	* Lib/WindowCursor.cs: Implement.

	* Lib/ByteArrayWindow.cs: Implement the functionality for
	ByteArrayWindow, do not derive from ByteWindow which is a design
	in the original Java implementation to use two different backends
	for storage.

	We could achieve the same in a cleaner way than the original
	implementation if we choose to do so using an interface.
