	* Lib/ByteArrayWindow.cs: Implement the functionality for
	ByteArrayWindow, do not derive from ByteWindow which is a design
	in the original Java implementation to use two different backends
	for storage.

	We could achieve the same in a cleaner way than the original
	implementation if we choose to do so using an interface.
